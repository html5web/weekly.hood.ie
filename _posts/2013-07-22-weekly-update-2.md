* [@ro-ka](https://github.com/ro-ka) created a [grunt-hoodie](https://github.com/ro-ka/grunt-hoodie) task that allows to start Hoodie with grunt.
  Combined with a grunt-connect proxy setting, this should simplify working with Hoodie & Grunt / Yeoman big time. Thanks Robert!
* setup weekly.hood.ie ([@gr2m](https://github.com/gr2m))
* added [@svnlto](https://github.com/svnlto) as core Hoodie member
* Got Hoodie running on Raspberry Pi and published the guide [Hoodieberry Pie: Hoodie on Raspberry Pi](http://blog.hood.ie/2013/07/hoodieberry-pi-hoodie-on-raspberry-pi-3/) ([@janl](https://github.com/janl))
