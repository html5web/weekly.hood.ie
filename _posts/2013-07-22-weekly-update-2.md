### Agenda

* [define coding standards, .editorconfig, .jshintrc for hoodie repos](https://github.com/hoodiehq/weekly-updates/issues/1)

### News

* @ro-ka created a [grunt-hoodie](https://github.com/ro-ka/grunt-hoodie) task that allows to start Hoodie with grunt.
  Combined with a grunt-connect proxy setting, this should simplify working with Hoodie & Grunt / Yeoman big time. Thanks Robert!
